# CLASSIFICATION OF ALZHEIMERâ€™S DISEASE USING MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH

# Project Summary
The aim of the study is to employ machine learning techniques in the classification of individuals 
as Healthy Control (HC) or Non-healthy Control (Non-HC) which include Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD combined as non-HC, as well as the identification of relevant 
and important predictors/features. 3 supervised learning- Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (Untuned and Tuned), and K-Nearest Neighbor, and 1 unsupervised learning- K-Means for Clustering was done
