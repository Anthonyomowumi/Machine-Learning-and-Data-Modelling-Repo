# CLASSIFICATION OF ALZHEIMERâ€™S DISEASE USING MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH

## Project Summary
The study employed 3 supervised learning- Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (Untuned and Tuned), and K-Nearest Neighbor, and 1 unsupervised learning- K-Means for Clustering machine learning techniques in the classification of individuals as Healthy Control (HC) or Non-healthy Control (Non-HC)  as well as the identification of relevant and important predictors/features. 

## I. Dataset Description
The AIBL non-imaging dataset consists of 862 (Participants) records and 32 Features. The features include categories like demographic, Medical History, ApoE genotypes, Neuropsychology assessments, blood analysis, and clinical diagnostic results of the participants.

The R programming language was used to explore the dataset. 

## II. Methodology
An efficient data mining approach was used to analyse the AIBL dataset.
