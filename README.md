# CLASSIFICATION OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE USING MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH

# Abstract

The most common cause of Dementia in the United Kingdom (UK) is Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Alzheimer’s Disease is a progressive condition with symptoms developing over the years
and it affects multiple brain functions. The aim of the study is to employ machine learning techniques in the classification of individuals 
as Healthy Control (HC) or Non-healthy Control (Non-HC) which include Mild Cognitive Impairment and AD combined as non-HC, as well as the identification of relevant 
and important predictors/features. The dataset used for the study was sourced from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL). 

The R programming language was used for data preprocessing, mining, and model fitting. The data set was divided into 70% (780) and 30% (335). 3 supervised learning- Random Forest,
Support Vector Machine (Untuned and Tuned), and K-Nearest Neighbor, and 1 unsupervised learning- K-Means for Clustering was done. 
The best-predicting model was Random Forest with an Accuracy of 97%, Recall of 96%, AUC of 98.99%, and ROC Curve closer to 1, fitting only 12 features out of the 31 features.
