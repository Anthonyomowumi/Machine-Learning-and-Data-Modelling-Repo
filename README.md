# CLASSIFICATION OF ALZHEIMERâ€™S DISEASE USING MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH

## Project Summary
The study employed 3 supervised learning- Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (Untuned and Tuned), and K-Nearest Neighbor, and 1 unsupervised learning- K-Means for Clustering machine learning techniques in the classification of individuals as Healthy Control (HC) or Non-healthy Control (Non-HC)  as well as the identification of relevant and important predictors/features. 

## I. Dataset Description
The AIBL non-imaging dataset consists of 862 (Participants) records and 32 Features. The features include categories like demographic, Medical History, ApoE genotypes, Neuropsychology assessments, blood analysis, and clinical diagnostic results of the participants.

The R programming language was used to explore the dataset. 

## II. Methodology
An efficient data mining approach was used to analyse the AIBL dataset.

### a) Data Preprocessing which involves data cleaning and selection, outliers detection and error detection, missing value imputation and correlation co-efficient*****

### c) Data Distribution
The outcome variable (Diagnosis) was checked for proportionality and found to be imbalanced with class 1(HC) having 609 and class 2 (non-HC) having 253. Using Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) and k set to 3, the data was balanced to 609 (HC) and 506 (non-HC) respectively
